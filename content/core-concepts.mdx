# Core Concepts

Understanding the fundamental concepts of train-lle will help you build effective machine learning models.

## What is a Local Learning Engine

A Local Learning Engine performs all machine learning computations locally on your device, without relying on cloud services or external APIs. This approach ensures data privacy and allows for offline operation.

## Models

Models in train-lle are neural networks composed of layers. Each layer transforms input data through mathematical operations.

### Layer Types
- **Dense**: Fully connected layer
- **Convolutional**: For image processing
- **Recurrent**: For sequence data

## Datasets

Datasets represent your training data. train-lle supports various formats:

- CSV files
- JSON arrays
- Image directories
- Custom data loaders

## Training Loop

The training process involves:
1. Forward pass: Data flows through the model
2. Loss calculation: Measure prediction error
3. Backward pass: Compute gradients
4. Parameter update: Adjust model weights

## Loss Functions

Loss functions quantify how well your model performs:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: For regression
- **Cross-Entropy**: For classification
- **Binary Cross-Entropy**: For binary classification

## Optimizers

Optimizers update model parameters to minimize loss:

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rate
- **RMSProp**: Root Mean Square Propagation
