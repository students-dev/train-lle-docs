# Getting Started

Welcome to train-lle, the Local Learning Engine for Node.js. This guide will help you get up and running with your first machine learning project.

## What is train-lle?

train-lle is a lightweight, privacy-focused machine learning library that runs entirely in your browser or Node.js environment. It prioritizes local computation to keep your data secure and private.

## Installation

Install train-lle using npm:

```bash
npm install train-lle
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of training a linear regression model:

```typescript
import { Model, Trainer, Dataset } from 'train-lle';

// Create a simple model
const model = new Model({
  layers: [
    { type: 'dense', units: 1, activation: 'linear' }
  ]
});

// Load your data
const dataset = new Dataset([
  { input: [1], output: [2] },
  { input: [2], output: [4] },
  { input: [3], output: [6] },
  { input: [4], output: [8] }
]);

// Train the model
const trainer = new Trainer(model, dataset);
trainer.train({ epochs: 100 });

// Make a prediction
const prediction = model.predict([5]);
console.log(prediction); // Should be close to [10]
```

## Project Philosophy

### Local-First
All computation happens locally in your environment. No data is sent to external servers.

### Privacy-First
Your training data never leaves your machine, ensuring complete privacy and security.

### Simple API
Designed with simplicity in mind, making machine learning accessible to developers of all levels.
