# What is a Model?

A model in machine learning is a mathematical representation of a real-world process that can make predictions or decisions based on input data.

## Neural Networks

train-lle uses neural networks as its primary model type. Neural networks are composed of:

- **Layers**: Organized groups of neurons
- **Neurons**: Individual computational units
- **Connections**: Weighted links between neurons
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear transformations

## Model Architecture

Models are defined by their architecture:

```typescript
const model = new Model({
  layers: [
    { type: 'dense', units: 64, activation: 'relu' },
    { type: 'dense', units: 32, activation: 'relu' },
    { type: 'dense', units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid' }
  ]
})
```

## Training Process

Models learn through:
1. **Forward Pass**: Input data flows through the network
2. **Loss Calculation**: Error between prediction and actual
3. **Backpropagation**: Error gradients flow backward
4. **Weight Updates**: Parameters adjusted to reduce error

## Model Capabilities

Once trained, models can:
- Make predictions on new data
- Classify inputs into categories
- Generate outputs based on patterns
- Learn complex relationships
