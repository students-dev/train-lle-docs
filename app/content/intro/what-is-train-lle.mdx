# What is train-lle?

train-lle is a lightweight, zero-dependency machine learning library for Node.js that allows you to train neural networks entirely on your local machine. Unlike cloud-based ML services, train-lle keeps your data private and doesn't require internet connectivity.

## Why It Matters

In an era where data privacy is increasingly important, train-lle empowers developers to build intelligent applications without compromising user data. Whether you're building recommendation systems, image classifiers, or predictive models, train-lle makes machine learning accessible and secure.

## Your First Example

Here's a simple example of creating and training a basic model:

```typescript
import { Model, Dataset } from 'train-lle'

// Create a simple dataset
const data = new Dataset([
  { input: [0, 0], output: [0] },
  { input: [0, 1], output: [1] },
  { input: [1, 0], output: [1] },
  { input: [1, 1], output: [0] }
])

// Create a neural network model
const model = new Model({
  layers: [
    { type: 'dense', units: 4, activation: 'relu' },
    { type: 'dense', units: 1, activation: 'sigmoid' }
  ]
})

// Train the model
await model.train(data, { epochs: 100 })

// Make a prediction
const prediction = model.predict([1, 0])
console.log(prediction) // Should be close to [1]
```

<Callout type="tip">
Remember to install train-lle first with `npm install train-lle` before running this code.

## What's Next?

Now that you know what train-lle is, let's explore what makes it a "Local Learning Engine" and why local ML matters.
