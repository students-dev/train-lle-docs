# Local Learning Engine

The "Local Learning Engine" refers to train-lle's unique approach to machine learning that prioritizes local execution, data privacy, and developer control.

## Key Principles

### 1. Local Execution
All model training and inference happens on your local machine. No data leaves your environment.

### 2. Zero Dependencies
train-lle has no external dependencies beyond Node.js, making it truly portable.

### 3. Privacy by Design
Your data never touches cloud servers or third-party services.

## Why Local Matters

In traditional ML workflows, you often need to:
- Upload datasets to cloud platforms
- Pay for compute resources
- Trust third parties with your data
- Deal with API rate limits

With train-lle, you retain full control and privacy.
